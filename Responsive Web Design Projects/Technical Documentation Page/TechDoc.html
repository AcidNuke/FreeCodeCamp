                Project Building is, and has always been a struggle for most. Many people find themselves in a space
                where they are unsure where and what to start with. How to setup the base and how to finish it off.
                This Document serves as a guide to assist those in similar positions as to myself. This document will
                outline some starting points and how to progress from them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will explain some basic ways to get started and look at things that you will need to best assist with
                the process. Dont feel obliged to follow this guide word for word, use it purely as a reference. I have
                broken the document into various parts so that it's easier to reference back to a specific point if you
                get stuck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never assume that all documentation is correct, it's only as good as the way you interpret it. This
                document serves only as a guide and cannot be taken as the ultimate, as there are various takes and
                ways to actually accomplish the takes at hand. Use this at your own risk.

            </header>
            <p>
                Before starting anything new you will always need a plan of action. You will need to decide what your
                goal is and then what you need to do, to get there. In some cases you have all of this all ready , if
                that is the case that's great. So you will find this very easy. It's important to understand that not
                everyone does this in the same way so even if your way of doing it differ from the set out way, carry
                on with your way, just as long as you can come to the same conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the way you handle these situations there are many ways to approach the issue at hand.
                Some prefer paper, some digital the choice is yours. I prefer to take the digital route to start my
                scoping phase. Markdown makes for the perfect platform to take down notes and create simple lists to
                assist with the mapping. You can combine your markdown files with Images and diagrams scanned, drawn or
                generated to create a full comprehensive list of everything you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let look at what you will need to get yourself setup and ready to take on any challenge. I will create
                a brief list of things that I find useful for creating projects.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some pens and paper<i style="font-size: 80%;"> (This is handy even when going digital)</i></li>
                <li>Your choice of Text Editor, as I mentioned I use Markdown files, and use it in conjunction with VS
                    Code.</li>
                <li>Time. Be sure to setup time to work on your project.</li>
                <li>You will need diaagrams, and/ or graphs to illustrate and map your ideas.</li>
                <li>Peers to proof read what you have.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As a final note don't try and finish it all in one go. These things take time and you can always come
                back to it later, and make adjustments. It's better to have only a few points than to have nothing.
                Just make sure you dont give up and always try your best.

            <header class="section-header">
                <h2>Build a Model</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Building your Model might not sound relevant, but if you think of a model as a plan of action it is
                more relevant than you think. In you model you only need to show the outlines of what you want to
                achieve. Whether it's bullet points or a flow diagram, just basic information is required. You can
                start adding in more details now but this is the focus of the next section. We just need to make sure
                that all our points have been put down, as no project can come to life when it lives in your head.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this phase it's important not to limit yourself to anything. Everything is still possible. We are
                not worried about what we cannot complete at this point. You need to remember with enough time and
                dedication everything becomes possible. You can go crazy with your idea's here, you will refine them
                later and then work on the points which are easily within your grasp.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use short but descriptive words in your model, this is to avoid the issue a few days down the line you
                forgot what you actually wanted to accomplish. Combining your list's and your diagrams may help with
                this process, use the list's to drive the detail points and the diagrams to show how they are related.
                In the end of this process you need to have some idea of how this whole project will fit together.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you make progress on your model, you will also find that certain models work better for displaying
                different kinds of projects. You won't necessarily use the same model for a box-cart plan as what you
                would use for building a bank management system. So be sure to find the diagram or model that best
                suites your end goal.

                <h2>Add Detail</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                For the detail phase, as the name suggests we will be filling in all the gaps. There are a few ways to
                approach this step. We will look at 3 steps that I find useful, bear in mind that there are lot's of
                other ways to do this.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Break apart the model into pieces and add details individually</li>
                <li>Use the entire model and write use cases</li>
                <li>Link the similar items and Build them into their own small projects</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <strong>Breaking Up the Model:</strong><br>
                <p style="padding: 0 0 0 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    This will require you to take the model you built and then start adding in details to each point on
                    the list. This is quite a long process, and lots of unnecessary details gets added in this manner.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <strong>Creating Use Cases:</strong><br>
                <p style="padding: 0 0 0 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    This approach is very different to the first method as we try to apply scenarios to the items in
                    our model, and by adding the scenarios we can see what detail should be added at each point in
                    order to fulfill the tasks set out by the use cases. This is a good way to apply the base points to
                    a typical everyday problem.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
                <strong>Create Small Projects:</strong><br>
                <p style="padding: 0 0 0 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    In a similar way to the use cases the project grouping and break up process. Assists us to fit
                    together our project, by knowing what points relate to each other we can refine our list and that
                    itself adds detail to our points on the model. Once broken up into the various sub-projects the
                    details required will start to reveal itself.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once your complete with this phase, you should have a list of task, and then attached to the tasks you
                will have all the information required to make that task happen. As in the previous phases it was
                stated that we can always go back to make adjustments, it also applies to this phase just be sure to
                not change the core as it can result in all your progress being lost.

            </header>
            <p>
                Knowing where to start is quite a difficult decision to make. A simple point to keep in mind when
                trying to decide where to start is, you need to decide what or who will be the parent or container for
                your project items. In order to keep everything in order you need to have it contained within
                something. It can range from a book to keep notes, a database to contain your data, or even to a hanger
                to store you rocket ship. Once you know what the container will be you can use that as a starting
                point.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have the base setup, you can start filling in the details to build up your base. Start at the
                bottom at the most relevant, and work up to the most irrelevant items. This way your focus is always on
                finishing your base first and then the most important items, before you start to add fancy font's for
                example.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always keep in mind what your end goal is, and use that to decide what is important and what can go in
                the, I'll do that later bucket. The more time you spend on the base the easier you will see how the
                other items fit into your project as a whole. By doing thing you will also find where you might have
                left out some detail. Be sure to always go back to your initial plan of action and make sure you are
                still inline with what your main goal was.

            <p>
                A very important point to remember is to never stop half way with any of the tasks. Complete one thing
                before you move on to the next to keep the main focus constant. As humans we tend to get side tracked
                easily so always do your best to complete the task at hand now, and not later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be sure to check off all the items from your list once you have completed them, and make sure you do
                congratulate and award yourself for each item you finish. Even if you just sit and stare at those
                nicely chromed accessories on your kit muscle car, that also counts as a reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you cannot complete a point on your list now, just move past and work on something else, get help
                and advise if needed, dont be afraid to ask. In the end you will complete everything. It will take time
                and effort, but so are all good things in life.
